# CS 4641 - Machine Learning (Spring 2023)
I took CS 4641 in the Spring of 2023.

Lectured by Dr. Mahdi Roozbahani.

## About
[Official course listing page](https://oscar.gatech.edu/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=202205&subj_code_in=CS&crse_numb_in=4641).

Our final project was written in Python and used Scikit and .ipynb (interactive python notebook) files. Our dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
### Course Curriculum
Machine learning methods:
1. Basic math for data science and machine learning
    - Linear algebra
    - Probability and statistics
    - Information theory
    - Optimization
2. Unsupervised machine learning for data exploration
    - Clustering analysis
    - Dimensionality reduction
    - Kernal density estimation
3. Supervised learning for predictive data analysis
    - Tree-based models
    - Support vector machines
    - Linear classification and regression
    - Neural networks

### Final Project
I'd love to have forked and linked our team's final report, but I don't believe I can do that or that I would be allowed to do that anyhow.

However, I believe I can describe what my team and I did.

Data Collection, Visualization, Preprocessing
  - Imported the dataset
  - Cleaned the dataset
  - Visulized the dataset
  - Split the dataset into train and test sets
  - Balanced our dataset
  - Feature Selection

We chose to incoporate 3 surpervised learning algorithms into 3 different models:
- Logistic Regression - Linear model
- Random Forest - Ensemble method
- Neural Network (MLP -  Multilayer Perceptron) - Deep learning

We then evaluated the accuracy of those models and interpretted the results.

# Disclaimer
As most of the course content belongs to either the College or the Professors, I am transcribing my work and assignments to record the course.

As such, many assignments and files **may not include detailed descriptions or solutions**. This is done to avoid violations, avoid doxing myself and others, and any number of other reasons. If, for any reason, the full repo must be accessed, all assignments, descriptions, solutions, and class files are stored in a private version of the repo (so contact me. If you're a current student, don't bother since I won't give you access and it wouldn't help you anyway xp).

If possible, portions of the class will be linked to a separate readme explaining more about the linked assignment/solution/description/other.

If there exist any honor code violations or any problems/solutions are *too* in-depth, please contact me. The intention of each public class repo is to record my experience and assignments of each class taken.
